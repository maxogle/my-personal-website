        <h1>WELCOME TO WEB 5</h1>
        <p>So much is being said about the "advent" of "Web 3" or the "Metaverse".  Well guess what boomer consider yourself analog because WEB 5 is here. </p>
        <p>I Max Ogle prospective student of The Flatiron School and web/software engineer neophyte have discovered through what seems on the surface like blind luck(but is really the climax of a prophetic journey) the pinnacle of web technology and experience.  What is WEB 5?  Wouldn't you like to know? If you're asking that question I'd(me Max Ogle) suggest you be a Venture Capitalist, Head of State, or James Bond style villain holding my family hostage. If that doesn't describe you, sorry bubby you have to wait with the other people who don't have access to Wealth, Power, or a laser/somehow my family!</p>
        <p>You might be thinking "I don't know Max, it seems like the metaverse is cool, I can chill with all my friends at Cyber-Denny's!". Yeah ok have fun with that, no passion, no soul, no imagination. If you want to get in on the ground floor of the fatherest reaches of the universe/ pure human conciousness it can only be WEB 5. So if you if you're ready to jack in, give me money, I'll see you at Cyber-Waffle House.</p>
